"629",2018-03-22,"LG Innotek Co. has lost 1.36 trillion Korean won ($1 billion) in value after hitting an 8-year high in August and it
has Apple Inc. to thank. Amid reports of weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X product, JPMorgan
slashed its target price on the supplier by 6.9 percent to 135,000 won citing a series of iPhone X-related
component order cuts. LG Innotek, which derives about 46 percent of its revenue from Apple, will miss market
expectations for its first-quarter earnings and could see further downside if the Korean won continues to
strengthen, analysts led by Jay Kwon wrote in a report."

and software tailored for schools in an effort to regain U.S. market share lost to rivals. Chromebook laptops
powered by Alphabet Inc.’s Google software accounted for 60 percent of laptops, tablets and other mobile
computers shipped to K-12 schools in the third quarter of 2017, while iPads made up only 12 percent of sales,
according to Futuresource Consulting. As Bloomberg Gadfly’s Shira Ovide writes, schools have become a
battleground for technology companies to build loyalty among future buyers and Apple needs children to help
keep the iPad going."

after peaking at the end of last year, suggesting demand for the high-end device may have faded just a quarter
after its release. While Hai Precision Industry Co., Pegatron Corp. and three other key suppliers reported an 8
percent rise in their total sales across the March quarter, growth slowed sharply later in the period -- a drop that in
